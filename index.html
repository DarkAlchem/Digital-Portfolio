                    <p>I’m a creative who believes “It’s not about getting it done, it’s about getting it done right.” I’ve been a graphic designer for 15+ years and a Web Developer for 9+ years.<br/><br />
                    I’ve worked for two marketing and branding firms and have been a lead web
                    developer for a team of three.<br /><br />
                    My current goal is to dive into the world of Game Development and Design. I have experience coding in HTML, CSS, Javascript/Jquery, REACT, PHP and Actionscript. I currently enjoy creating clean, responsive website themes with Wordpress backends.</p>

                    <h4 class="job-title">Technical Lead <span class="job-date">2013-2019</span></h4>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Development team was disorganized and needed some modernization with it's practices and
                    Methodologies<br />
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> Became Technical Lead after introducing Agile Methodologies, SCRUM practices and migrated
                    the development process from native HTML, CSS, and JS to a LAMP tech stack with Wordpress at it's core.</p>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Any content updates that needed to be made had to be performed by a developer.<br />
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> By including Advanced Custom Fields in the development process, we were able to create fields for data insertion regardless of skill level.</p>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Web Applications had to be built from scratch each time.<br />
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> Moved our development lifecycle to create bespoke themes for clients, while creating a library of reusable components that can be reused with web clients in the future with flexible content fields and ACF.</p>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Web Applications were taking upwards of 5 months to build.<br />
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> Reduced the development lifecycle to 2 months by introducing AGILE Methodologies and a component library.</p>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> They wanted to remake the company site.<br />
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> Using my background in animation and design, I created all the HTML animations for the site. Created several components that would be used by the company to build content for the site.</p>
