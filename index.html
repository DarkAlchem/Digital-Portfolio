                developer for a team of three.<br /><br />
                My current goal is to dive into the world of Game Development and Design. I have experience coding in HTML, CSS, Javascript/Jquery, REACT, and PHP. I have experience in platforms such as Wordpress, ServiceNow, and Laravel.

            <section>
                <h3 class="job-name">Accenture Federal Services</h3>
                <h4 class="job-title">Custom Software Engineer <span class="job-date">2022-2025</span></h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>Problem:</strong> Client needed updates to their website that uses ServiceNow.<br />
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> I authored several custom UI/UX updates for the Department of Labor and USAC. I've worked with Widgets, Angular Providers, UI Policies along with HTML, CSS, and JS to create UI updates to meet the clients specifications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Problem:</strong> Application would lag upon data updates, these performance issues needed to be resolved swiftly.<br />
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> I coordinated with my team to create a plan that would offer updates from inception to test to prod push that would resolve the performance issues within 5 business days. The result ended with a happy client and a nomination for a firefighter award.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Problem:</strong> Application is reliant on API calls, causing resources to be used that could apply to other services <br />
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> With guidance, moved from API calls to included JS files. This returned resources back since API calls were no longer used.

                <p>
                    <strong>Problem:</strong> The client required a feature for their website to manage projects that they could easily edit.<br />
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> I authored a plugin that created a new post type and allowed for new custom template pages for the most flexibility. The single post pages were combined with ACF to create simple input fields for my client to include the content for the project. A plugin architecture was used to avoid the issue of a client changing themes and the functionality no longer working for them.

                    <strong>Problem:</strong> The Client wanted a form on their Wordpress site that we could output the results to a PDF for the customer to download<br />
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> Using ACF, jsPDF.js and Bootstrap, I created a front end form that output to a multipage PDF when their customers hit the download button. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Problem:</strong> The Client wanted to collect demographic data<br />

                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Problem:</strong> The Client wanted to see the demographic data, be allowed to sort data and download data as a CSV<br />
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> I created an additional tab on the wordpress dashboard that allowed the client not only to see the data, but sort it and included a button that allowed the downloading of the data. I also went a step above and created a table that showed the percentage of users in each of the specific demographics that the site was collecting.

                    <strong>Problem:</strong> Wanted to dive deeper into a component way of building<br />
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> Built an App using Adobe Animate and actionscript to create an endless runner platformer. Researched games such as Temple Run, Sailor Dash, and Sonic Dash to create a concept to explore the component way of building games.

                    <strong>Solution:</strong> Researched several games and soundtracks that make the game. Looked at games like Sonic the Hedgehog, Celeste, and Final Fantasy to explore music in short durations then hired a Musician that could match that aestethic.

                <p>
                    <strong>Problem:</strong> Need to test the game for bugs or issues<br />

                <p>
                    <strong>Problem:</strong> Wanted to intergrate more features of Google's Play API into the game<br />
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> Worked with distriqt to add Adobe Native Extentions(ANE's) into the game. It currently has a Leaderboard, Application Rater, Google Analytics, and a in-game shop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Problem:</strong> Whether to release the game as buy-to-play or a free-to-play model<br />
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> Decided to release the game as a free-to-play game as is the current landscape of majority of mobile games to compete. Monetized the app through implementing Google Adsense and an in-game storefront by using ads at the end of each short play session and microtransactions for cosmetics.
